# DENO REACT EXAMPLE

Made following the steps from the following [craigmorten's medium post](https://dev.to/craigmorten/writing-a-react-ssr-app-in-deno-2m7).

**Before running make sure that you have at least `deno v1.2.0` installed on your system**

Ways to run:

1. If on a \*NIX system can use `./run.sh`

2. If on any not \*NIX systems `deno run --allow-net --allow-read ./server.tsx` can be used directly.
